### **About Me**

Hi there! Iâ€™m a 20-year-old web & software engineer from London, England, UK.

I first dived into programming when I was 13, building server-sided modifications in Java for one of the most popular games - Minecraft. I have since gone on to build a multitude of websites and platforms, driving traffic through organic growth thanks to SEO and social media marketing.

I have a passion in collecting premium, one-word domain names and forming solutions to issues I have personally faced. Up until recently, I worked for an insurance company at 20 years old, where I built a fully-fledged fraud detection system that used a series of inter-connected checks to find risky customers. This shown to key stakeholders, in addition to other large figures in the insurance industry.

A year ago, I launched my business that grew to 200 concurrent visitors, and 800,000 monthly visits before selling it for 5 figures through the [MicroAcquire](https://microacquire.com) platform. I have now gone full-time on building [Analyse](https://analyse.net/?ref=github_profile), a game server analytics solution to make it easier to track community performance through key metrics.
